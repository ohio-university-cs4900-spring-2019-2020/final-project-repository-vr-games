oneLightNoTexture -

Maintains fixed functionality vertex transformation.
Matches fixed functionality lighting, except specularity is done per pixel.
Only calculates lighting for LIGHT0.
Does not attempt to apply textures.

oneLight -

Maintains fixed functionality vertex transformation.
Matches fixed functionality lighting, except specularity is done per pixel.
Only calculate lighting for LIGHT0.
Applies textures for TEXTURE0 only, assuming a 2D texture, using GL_MODULATE.


discardColorRange -

Uniforms:

vec3 color - the rgb values of the mean color values of the range to discard
float epsilon - the extent of the color values from the mean to discard (should be slightly larger than 0 at the tightest)
sample2D texture - texture to use

Vertex Shader:

Fixed Functionality

Fragment Shader:

Returns texel value of "texture" at given texture coordinate but discards all fragments whose texel value is within epsilon in rgb channels from "color."

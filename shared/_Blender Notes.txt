Some of the blender files have a "_pp" postfix.

PP stands for Post Processed.  These are blender model files that have the following
transformations applied in this order:

	A. Have had all Meshes joined to make 1 Object.
		1. Select all meshes ('A')
		2. Goto Object -> Join ('Ctrl+J')
		3. Confirm the join in the prompt.
	B. Have their "front" facing directly along the positive X axis and
           Have their "top" pointing directly along the positive Z axis.
           ***If you do not know EXACTLY what this means, see "Orientation Of Models in Blender" below.
		1. Select the object. (should only be one, see step A)
		2. Press R, the rotate the object to the desired orienation.
	C. Have had all Quads Converted to Triangles.	
		1. Select the object (should only be one, see step A)
		2. Switch to "Edit" mode.
		3. Goto Mesh -> Faces -> Convert Quads to Triangles ('Ctrl+T')
	D. Have all transform information "applied".
		1. Select the object.
		2. Switch to "Object" mode.
		3. Goto Object -> Clear/Apply -> Apply Scale/Rotation ('Ctrl+A')
	E. Have the model center (pink dot) at center of model.
		1. Select the object. (Object mode)
		2. Goto Object -> Transform -> Center new.
	F. Now ready to generate a wrl (VRML) file.
		1. Goto File -> Export -> VRML 1.0
		2. Type in a name, and goto desired location (/models/*.wrl)
		3. Open the VRML file in a text editor and change the texure reference
		   from "//whatever.jpg" to "//../models/whatever.jpg"

These steps are necessary to get the VRML properly loaded into the graphics engine, and to ensure they are oriented the way we want.  

I try to "branch" the blender files before these operations are performed because after these operations have been performed, it becomes more difficult to go back and manipulate the model if a change is necessary (near impossible).

So, before you do the steps above to your project:

	1. File --> Save As...
	2. Save as "my_filename_pp.blend" (obviously, replace 'my_filename')
	3. Commit _pp.blend to subversion, and use IT for generating wrl files

If a change is needed, modify the ORIGINAL (which will be easier), then regenerate the _pp.blend and the wrl if desired.

Orientation Of Models in Blender
------------------------------------

Ensure ALL models are in this alignment in blender before exporting them to VRML...

Assume we are orienting a BMW car with a  BMW hood ornament on the very front of its hood. The steering wheel is on the "left side" of the car (standard steering wheel position in the US)

1) The car model is centered at the origin
2) The car model is facing forwards along the positive x-axis. That is, the hood ornament is the part of the car furthest along the positive x-axis.
3) The back of the lies along (points towards) the negative x-axis.
4) The top of the car is furthest along the positive z-axis.
5) The bottom of the car lies along (points towards) the negative z-axis.

I have added a PICTURE into the repo describing the above scenario.... \steamie\multimedia\orientationExample.JPG
